# Scheduled Meeting Times

## Context and Problem Statement

What times/days is everyone free individually?
What is the best meeting day/time in which most people will be available?

## Considered Options

* Sunday: 3-4 PM
* Monday: 2-3 PM
* Friday: 2-3 PM

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Sunday at 3 to 4 PM". Based on the When2Meet schedule that everyone filled out, Sunday and Monday around 2 or 3 PM is when most people are free. Friday at 2-3 PM is also okay, but not as good as Sunday or Monday. Since assignments are generally due Sunday instead of Monday, the meetings will occur every week on Sunday at 3-4 PM (unless stated otherwise). We may also meet during the week, which will be discussed and posted to slack.
