# Scheduled Meeting Times

## Context and Problem Statement

As a team working collaboratively on weekly sprints, it is important to establish a predicatable and consistent schedule for:
- Regular standups
- Assigning and clarifying work
- Adjusting timelines based on progress or blockers
- Planning ahead for upcoming tasks and deliverables.

The team needed to identify time slots where most or all team members are available, based on a When2Meet poll. 

## Considered Options

* Sunday: 3-4 PM
* Monday: 2-3 PM
* Friday: 2-3 PM

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Sunday at 3 to 4 PM". Based on the When2Meet schedule that everyone filled out, Sunday and Monday around 2 or 3 PM is when most people are free. Friday at 2-3 PM is also okay, but not as good as Sunday or Monday. Since assignments are typically due Sunday night, the meeting at 3-4 pm (unless stated otherwise) provides the team a final opportunity to align or complete any outstanding work before the deadline. 

Friday Meetings (2-3 PM): Weekly Standup
  - Provides up on progress made and in progress tasks
  - Identify any blockers
  - Ensure team members are aligned
  - Split up work early in the cycle (if needed)
  
Monday (2-3 PM): Assignment Planning
  - Review any new assignments
  - Assign tasks for the sprint
  - Ensure the team is aligned

Sunday (3-4 PM): Working Session
  - Discuss and finalize weekly deliverables
  - Work on weekly assignment
  - Working collaboratively if something is incomplete

## Consequences

- Meets will follow a flexible but consistent rhythm.
- Designated "as-needed" policy for Sunday meetings provides structure without focing uncessary sessions.
- Meeting changes will be posted to Slack to ensure everyone is on the same page.
