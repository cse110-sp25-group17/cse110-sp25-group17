# Create a Pokemon App for the project

## Context and Problem Statement

What card app should we build? 

## Considered Options

* Flashcards
* Cards Against Humanity
* Pokemon
* Movie Night Picker

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Pokemon", because majority of the group voted in favor of creating the Pokemon app. Some of the other options would be harder to implement as a singleplayer game (Cards against humanity), while others just weren't as interesting or fun to build. Pokemon cards would be easier to implement since they would all have similar layouts, with only minor changes.
