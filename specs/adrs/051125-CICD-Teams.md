# CI/CD Decisions and Teams

## Context and Problem Statement
How are we going to divide the work for the CI/CD pipeline assignment and the ADR documentation?

## Considered Options

* Tackle indivdual tasks
* Split into small groups to work on specific task
* Whole team works otgether


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Splitting into teams because it allows everyone to contribute to the team and helps finish the task faster compared to being inone large group. Divided the CI/CD pipeline assignment into three groups, one working on code quality/linting, one working on unit testing, and one on documentation.
