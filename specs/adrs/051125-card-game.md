# Create a Pokemon App for the project

## Context and Problem Statement

As a team, we needed to decide what type of card application to build for our project. The goal was to select an idea that:
- Meets all CRUD requirements
- Align with individual and group interest
- Is manageable but is a meaningful challenge

## Considered Options

* Flashcards
  * Pros:
    * Simple and easy to implement with consistyent layouts
    * Clear layout
  * Cons:
    * Lacks engagement
    * Less Appealing as overall group project theme
* Cards Against Humanity
  * Pros:
    * Popular and humorous concept
    * Good for multi user interaction
  * Cons:
    * Implementing a multi player format
* Pokemon
  * Pros:
    * Fun and a widely recognizable concept
    * Consistent card structure
    * Visual appeal
    * Popular amongst team members
  * Cons:
    * Require API for data
* Movie Night Picker
  * Pros:
    * Simple interface and logic
    * Similar data layout to Pokemon
  * Cons:
    * May be less exicting to build compared to other options

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Pokemon", because majority of the group voted in favor of creating the Pokemon app. Some of the other options would be harder to implement as a singleplayer game (Cards against humanity), while others just weren't as interesting or fun to build. Pokemon cards would be easier to implement since they would all have similar layouts, with only minor changes. The Movie Night Picker would also somewhat simple to implement, and similarly to the Pokemon cards all movie card would have similar layouts. 

## Consequences

- Increased team motivation due to shared interest in the Pokemon theme.
- String alignment with project requirements while remaining creative.
- Sourcing of visual assets.
