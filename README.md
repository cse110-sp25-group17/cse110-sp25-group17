## How to run the app
To run the application, navigate to the app's [homepage.](https://cse110-sp25-group17.github.io/cse110-sp25-group17/source/home_page.html) From the homepage, you navigate to the flashcards, the quiz game, or the collection. <br> <br>

If you want to test your pokemon knowledge, navigate to the flashcards from the homepage by clicking on the 'Go to Flashcards' button. Flashcards of obtainable pokemon will be displayed on the screen. Clicking on the 'Next' or 'Previous' buttons will change the flashcard. <br> <br>

If you want to obtain new pokemon cards, navigate to the quiz game from the homepage by clicking on the 'Go to Game' button. An image of a pokemon will be displayed. Correctly selecting the pokemon type and name will add the pokemon card to your collection. <br> <br>

In order to check the pokemon cards you have obtained, navigate to the collection page from the homepage by clicking on the 'Go to Collection' button. All of the obtained pokemon cards will be displayed in the collection. Clicking on a pokemon in the collection will allow you to edit its nickname ('Edit Nickname' button) or remove it from your collection ('Delete Pokemon' button). Since the app currently only allows you to obtain generation 1 pokemon, you can add pokemon from other generations by clicking on the 'Add Pokemon' button. Inputting the name of a pokemon (not generation 1) adds the pokemon to your collection.
