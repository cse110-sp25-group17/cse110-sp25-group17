### Meeting Notes
- Have to build a card app, that isn't like the warmup
- Created a [Miro workspace](https://miro.com/welcome/WmprU2xLNWNKQXNMekE0MjRLT3hMSVlGSHV6TitDdHhKYXFxN1lNcHdTam5OZFFmUklqL2Jlb1M4emd4Um95bVNZajAyc0hWMkg2WmR4cE16dkFidG0yOEhYc0ZnUGFUMGlDd1pxci9PWEFBYWEvdTRPazdUaWdTQkdZUHR0aW5Bd044SHFHaVlWYWk0d3NxeHNmeG9BPT0hdjE=?share_link_id=940955294826)
- Proposed Ideas:
  - Flashcards
    - Can incorporate Pokemon into it
      - i.e type, evolution, forms, etc
      - a lot of features to explore beyond a basic flashcard
    - Very versatile
    - CRUD:
      - User "creating" flashcard game they want to be tested on
        - Template to create their card
          - Select type, evolution, etc
          - Different filters (generations)
  - Cards against humanity
    - Hard to do as a single player
    - Assigning value based on prompt
    - Would need a database to store items
  - Daily affirmation cards
  - Knock off Pokemon
  - Movie Night Picker
    - With every movie being a card
    - Create movie cards,
      - interested opening up a detail page (i.e genre, actors, etc)
- Core idea needs to work before moving towards more features
- Team Explored how we can integrate the Pokemon idea with the idea of Flashcards
- Team brainstormed CRUD for two app ideas
  - Flashcard with Pokemon integration and Movie Night Picker
- Team voted between Pokemon and Movie Night
  - 1 Voted for Movie Night
  - 8 Voted for Pokemon
    - Wins by majority
- Can potentially use Gemini
  -  Calls to Gemini using a key. Having it compile questions
  - Storing Questions and Answers. Storing it to database
  - Once imfo is called from database, then flashcard is created
- Start with 151 cards then build from there
  - Can expand to beyond 151 cards if time allows
- Have all cards formatted a certain way
  - splitting up the work
- Potentially using AI to give info about each card, then stores it
  - Need to ensure its consistency
