# Sprint 1 Retrospective
5/18/25

 ## What went well
 - Strong ownership of tasks
   - Each team member took clear responsibility for different areas
 - Strong collaboration on tooling and quality
   - A variety of items was implemented to ensure code quality and enforcing standards
 - Bug identitification and fixes
   - With Codacy we were note an issue that was not caught by human reviewers and was able to push a fix to ensure quality standards
 - Collaboration amongst teams
   - Teams collaborated together to make things work

## What could be improved
- Communication Gaps
  - Lack of timely and consistent communication between the team
- Meeting Engagement
  - Low attendance or engagement in meetings made coordiation more difficult
- Lack of Task structure
  - Work was self assigned without clear planning or delegation. 
- Delayed Start
  - Started in the middle of the week rather than the beginning

## Actions for Next Sprint
- Strictly enforce daily checkins
  - Provides everybody with an update regardless of tasks completed
- Better communication protocol
  - Update understanding between team surroudning communications
- Structured Task System
  - Rather than having each person self assign a task, assign the tasks ahead of time
  - Using GitHub Issues
- Starting earlier (Monday rather than Wednesday), thus giving everybody ample time for the sprint.
