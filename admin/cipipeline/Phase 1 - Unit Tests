## Unit tests via automation
* Will implement jest unit tests
  * Create js test files
  * Run them on Jest

## Why use Jest?
* It runs all test cases for you
* Compares expected vs actual results
* Reports pass/fail status

## Focus unit tests on key functions including:
* Card selection logic 
* Question generation and mapping to card
* Answer validation logic
* Add the card to the deck upon the correct answer

### Example test for card selection:

``` js
describe('selectCard', () => {
  const availableCards = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const obtainedCards = [6, 7];

  test('should return the card if it is in availableCards and not in obtainedCards', () => {
    const card = selectCard(3, availableCards, obtainedCards);
    expect(card).toBe(3); //if return the correspond card will Pass, otherwise will Fail
  });

  test('should return null if card is already in obtainedCards', () => {
    const card = selectCard(6, availableCards, obtainedCards);
    expect(card).toBeNull(); //return NULL will pass, otherwise will Fail
  });

  test('should return null if card is not in availableCards', () => {
    const card = selectCard(9, availableCards, obtainedCards);
    expect(card).toBeNull(); //return NULL will pass, otherwise will Fail
  });
});
```
