# Phase 1 CI/CD Pipeline

## Linting and Code Style Enforcement
  - use ESlint before merging to check for linting and code style
  - add as a GitHub action to automatically run ESlint

## Code quality via tool  (ex. Codeclimate, Codacy, etc.)
  - AI code review
  - Using codeclimate to check code quality before merging
    
## Code quality via human review 
  - minimum of 2 people check code to be able to be merged
  - Require pull requests before merging
  - added as a GitHub action
    
## Unit tests via automation 
  - Will implement jest unit tests
    
## Documentation generation via automation (ex. JSDocs)
  - write JSDocs in code for each feature/function
  - automatically generate detailed documentation after pull request

## Other testing including e2e (end to end) and pixel testing is also possible so you may decide to use an environment that does numerous things.
